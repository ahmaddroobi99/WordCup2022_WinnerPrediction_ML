# WordCup2022_WinnerPrediction_ML

You need to design a Machine Learning (ML) model to predict the results
of the last two matches in the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022, on 17 and
18.12.2022. You can use any features you want to build your model from the
current or the previous world cups, such as the total players evaluation, shots,
shots on target, possession, passes, pass accuracy, fouls, yellow cards, red
cards, offsides, corners, etc. Please perform the following steps (if required) or
any other steps you find them necessary:
Part 1 - Code:
• Data collection and integration.
• Data cleaning and transformation.
• Data visualization and analysis.
• Data reduction and feature selection.
• Building a model to predict the name of the winning team.
• Provide model evaluation. You may use the R-squared (R2
) to evaluate
your model
